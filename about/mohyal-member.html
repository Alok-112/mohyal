              For the nail-chewing skeptics this chapter will be an anathema but
              for the credos it will be heady euphoria. Its exclusion would have
              hurt the susceptibilities of the vintage class of Mohyals who have
              been fed on the inebriating elixir, over the ages. Even a Western
              rationalist like Russell Stracey could not overlook its
              overwhelming need, while writing his treatise on the Mohyals.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Mohyal pantheon of gods, every caste has its
              patriarch-saint and then there is also a second line of the divine
              forefathers. It is the patri arch-saint or the progenitor who
              bestows the Gotra on the clan, as a mark of its identity. These
              holy forefathers, although, steeped in mythology, were not
              fictitious figures but real historical characters like the ancient
              Hebrew Patriarchs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chief deities in the 'dev-mala' of the seven castes of the
              Mohyals are described below alongwith the gotra of each respective
              caste

          <div class="about-mohyal--cast">
            <h2>BALI (Parashar) – The divine forefathers</h2>
            <p>
              Parashara, the great exponent of astronomy and the author of
              Parashara Smriti and some hymns of Rigveda, was the son of Shakti
              Rishi and mother Adrshyanti. He was grandson of sage Vasishtha.
              After Shakti was devouvered by the rakshasa Kanmashapada, he was
              brought up by his grand­father, hence the name Parashara, i.e.
              dependent on another person. Rishi Vyasa, considered to be the
              literary incarnation of God, was son of Parashara from a
              fisher-woman named Kali or Matsya-gandha. His real name was
              Krishna because he was born in an island called Krishnadvaipayana.
              It was after he had classified the four Vedas that he was given
              the name of Vyasa or Vedavyasa. After arranging the Vedas, he
              wrote the Mahabharata (1 lakh slokas) at the Badarika Ashram.
              Later, under the instructions of his spiritual guru, Narada, he
              com­pleted the Shrimad Bhagvatam on the banks of the river
              Sarasvati. He was also the author of Vedanta Sutras, the Brahm
              Sutras and 18 Puranas. When he was writing the Mahabharata, he
              could not find a suitable script and requested Ganesha to help
              him. The latter consented on the condition that Vyasa will write
              the whole epic non-stop, in one session. Ganesha used his broken
              tusk as pen to write it. It was during his stay at the Badarika
              Ashram that Vyasa is believed to have begotten children from Amba
              and Ambalika, the widows of Vichitravirya, son of Santanu by
              Satyavati. Guru Poornima is celebrated in honour of Vedavyasa. His
              birth day falls on the full-moon day in the month of Ashada.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the way to Badarika Ashram, the Vyasa cave is still there where
              the sage dictated the epic to Ganesha and also edited the Vedas.
            </p>

            <h3>Bottomline:</h3>
            <p>
              According to mythology, the sage Vedavyasa when he was dictating
              the Mahabharata to Lord Ganesha, was disturbed by the roaring of
              the Sarasvati. He recited a mantra and threw a fistful of ashes
              into the river and it promptly vanished underground.
            </p>

            <h3>Here lived Vyasa:</h3>
            <p>
              About 2 km. off the main road, connecting Rourkela and Sambalpur
              (in Orissa), is Vedavyasa. The sylvan charm of the place is quite
              breathtaking and the ashram (a ruined cave) of Vyasadeva is on a
              small hillock besides the river Brahamani. Every morning the saint
              took bath in the waters of the Sarasvati, offering paeans to Lord
              Vishnu. Legend has it that Parashara lived near this place in a
              village that was known as 'Parashamunda'. When­ever he wanted to
              cross the river, a boatman used to ferry him across. Once when the
              boatman was not there, his daughter 'Matsyagandha' offered to
              ferry the saint across the river. The saint fell in love with the
              girl. Vyasadeva was their child. (The Hindu dated 17.9.95)
            </p>
            <h3>Valmiki (Adi Kavi) c-400 BC</h3>
            <p>
              The celebrated author of the Ramayana is consid­ered by tradition
              as an ancestor of the Balis, despite the pique of many Mohyals who
              do not savour the thought of calling a person who was once a
              highway bandit, as their divine forefather. Now, there is a new
              revelation which calls for having a second look at our family
              chart: Accord­ing to Dr. P.L. Bhargava, formerly Professor of
              Sanskrit in the University of Rajasthan and Profes­sor of Religion
              in McMaster University, Ontario, Canada; Valmiki was a descendant
              of the Vedic Rishi Bhrigu, since all the ancient works which
              mention him viz., the Ramayana itself, the Mahabharata, the Matsya
              Purana and the Vishnu Purana, are unanimous in declaring him as a
              scion of the Bhrigu family. The ancient poet Ashvaghosha who lived
              in the first century AD, likewise calls him a descendant of
              Chyvana, son of Bhrigu. This clearly establishes Valmiki as a
              patriarch not of Balis but of the Chhibber clan. The great bard
              gathered all the ballads of Rama into one poem. The Ramayana
              comprises seven books and has 24,000 cantos (48,000 lines) ---
              thrice the num­ber in the Iliad of Homer c-700 BC (15,693 lines)
              --- and 100 episodes.

          <div class="about-mohyal--cast">
            <h2>BHIMWAL (Koshal)</h2>
            <p>
              There was no Rishi who bore the name of Kosalya. In fact, Kosalya
              was the name of a region (the modern Oudh) and the people living
              there were known as Kosalyas or Koshals. It was a prosperous
              kingdom on the banks of river Sarayu and Ayodhya was its capital.
              The city was built by Manu Vaivasvata and in the noon of its
              heyday, it was 12 yojans (one yojana equal to nine miles) long and
              3 yojans broad. This was the land where the epic of the Ramayana
              was enacted. Its characters have been referred as Kosala Aryans by
              Dr. Hiralal, the re­nowned authority on the aborigines of Central
              India. Kosalya was ruled by kings who traced their descent from
              Ikshavaku whose descendants are mentioned in the Vedas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Kosala king Prasenajit was contemporary of Buddha. In the
              early Aryan Brahmana period, Kosala was one of the four most
              powerful king­doms; the other three being Avanti (capital Ujjain),
              Vatsa (capital Kausambhi, near Allahabad) and Magadha (embracing
              Patna and Gaya). The cities of Savatthi and Sarvasti have also
              figured as capitals of Kosala.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kosalya was the name of: the ruler Hiranya Nabha, and of the land
              as well as the people. There was also a dialect called Kosal or
              Avadhi which has produced one of the greatest poets, Tulsidas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The patron-saint of the Kosalyas was Agastya, a Gotrakara Rishi.
              In Matsya Purana, chapter 202, Kosalya is mentioned as a Gotra
              among the Agastyas. Agastya Rishi was born in Badami (Karnataka);
              he took the Vedic religion beyond the Vindhyas and Aryanised the
              Dravidians.

            <h2>CHHIBBER</h2>
            <h2>
              (Bhrigu/Bhargava) Descendants of Bhrigu are known as Bhargava
            </h2>
            <p>
              Bhrigu Rishi (author of Manava-Dharma-Shastra) is considered as
              the holy father of all Brahmins. He is believed to have been born
              from the skin of Brahma. The Puranas give the following account of
              his esoteric rebirth: Lord Brahma performed the sacramental yajna
              in the beginning of the world which led to the birth of his eight
              Manas Putras. Bhrigu was the first to emerge from the sacred fire,
              viz. Agni, hence given the name of Bhrigu. Then Shiva appeared in
              the incarnation of Varuna and adopted Bhrigu as his son, that is
              why he is also referred as Bhrigu Varuni. He had two wives, named
              Divya and Puloma, who were the daughters of Hrinyakashyap, an
              asura. Puloma gave birth to seven rishis, including Ashnas and
              Chyvan who founded the Bhargava dynasty. Chyvan had two sons,
              Aapatvan and Dadhichi, from his wife Sukanya. The line of great
              rishis: Richika, Jamadagni and Parashurama, descended from
              Aapatvan. The Bhargavas were the Raj Gurus of the Kshatriya rulers
              of Gujarat. For certain reasons their relations became strained
              and the Bhargavas migrated to the north and settled down in Kanya
              Kubaja (present Kanauj). The bad blood between the two people
              lasted for many generations and a climax was reached during the
              time of Parashurama' who inflicted 21 wars on the Kshatriyas of
              Gujarat, uprooted their power, and established his own su­premacy
              over the entire territory between the Ganga and the Narmada. His
              chief foe was Karttaviryarjuna. Parashurama held a yajna on the
              river Saraswati to commemorate his victory and to reaffirm his
              credentials. He offered the entire land conquered by him as
              Dakshina to Kashyap Rishi who was the master of the ceremonies.
              Kashyap Rishi, in his turn, distributed the land to the Brah­mins.
              Parashurama once confronted Sri Rama also, but was humbled by him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Parashurama was the grandson of Rishi Vishwamitra, the author of
              the Gayatri Mantra, who was the maternal uncle of Jamadagni. He
              had three brothers, the eldest one being Dev Datt. Some scholars
              have averred that Dev Datt and not Dronacharya was the prime
              ancestor of the Datt family.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Gayatri mantra is a hymn from the Rigveda dedicated to the
              solar god Savitru. It is also known as the Guru Mantra, Maha
              Mantra and Savitri Mantra. It is regarded as the most holy verse
              in Hindu scriptures. It may be recorded that Vishwamitra who
              composed the classic Gayatri mantra was born a Kshatri and by
              virtue of his piety and austerities admitted to the Brahmin
              or­der.

            <h3>THE LEGEND OF PARASHURAMA:</h3>
            <p>
              Vishwamitra was the son of Gadhi, a veteran of the Bharata family
              which figured in the Battle of the Ten Kings. Once, the Bhrigu
              patriarch Richik paid a visit to Gadhi and presented to him 1,000
              shiny black horses. In response, the pleased Gadhi mar­ried his
              daughter Sarasvati (sister of Vishwamitra) with Richik. From this
              wedlock the fiery Jamadagni was born. The Bhanja and Mama,
              Jamadagni and Vishwamitra, were nearly of the same age and brought
              up together. Jamadagni married Renuka, the daughter of King
              Ikshavaku. They begot four sons and the youngest was Parashurama.
              Jamadagni was a valcano of temper and when he came to know about
              the promiscuity of his wife Renuka with Raja Chitrarth, he asked
              his sons to kill her. While the elder ones refused to commit the
              heinous act, Parashurama who was made in the same burning mould as
              his father, felt no compunction in killing his mother. The name of
              Renuka, however, was immortalised as Renuka Yellamma, the goddess
              of the Devdasi cult. There is a temple in her honour at Soundatti
              near Belgaum in Karnataka.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mighty Parashurama fought 21 battles with the Kshatriyas, to
              avenge the murder of his father Jamadagni; filled five lakes of
              Samauta with their blood and totally annihilated their race.
              Later, in repentance, he flung his battle axe into the sea and
              from that sprang the lands of Konkan and Kerala.
            </p>
            <p>
              Parashurama converted the entire country into Arya Vrat and
              established many religious centres including the famous Sabrimala
              near Kottayam in Kerala.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Bhrigus were most powerful during the Vedic period. They ruled
              over the northern country from Sindhu to Narmada. (N.B:
              Bhrigukachha, the modern Broach is named after the Bhrigu clan of
              Parashurama). The Mahabharata is replete with their glorious
              deeds. They produced a galaxy of sages and thinkers like
              Shukracharya, Ashnas, Chyvan, Dadhichi, Richika, Jamadagni,
              Martandya, Devyani, Sukanya and Satyavati. Parashurama was the
              Dhruv Star amongst them. He taught warfare to Bhim, Baldev and
              Karan. His Dhanush even the mighty Ravana could not handle and it
              was only Sri Rama who was able to smash it. Mythology has it that
              once he had a fracas with Lord Ganesha and in the encounter
              knocked off his one tusk so that the elephant god is depicted with
              a single tusk.
            </p>
            <p>
              Parashurama was not accorded the title of a Rishi, he was elevated
              to the rank of god and proclaimed as an incarnation like Rama and
              Krishna. He came to be known as Bhagwan and the blessed sixth
              avatara of Vishnu. 'Valmiki has chanted his paeans.
            </p>
            <p>
              The era of Rigveda came to an end with Jamadagni and the age of
              powerful Brahmins commenced with Parashurama.
            </p>
            <p>
              The astrological work 'Bhrigu Samahita' was com-posed by a
              descendant of Bhrigu. The Samahita was written on the lake still
              known as the Bhrigu lake situated at an altitude of 14,000 ft.,
              surrounded by snow clad mountains, in Himachal Pradesh beyond
              Manali. According to a report published in India Today, July
              31,1993, the only copy of the legendary Bhrigu Samahita is in
              possession of the Bhrigu family of Hoshiarpur and the tome weighs
              1.6 tonnes. Bhriguji of Hoshiarpur has a large following amongst
              ministers, industrialists and cinema celebrities and is regarded
              as an incarnation of Vishnu.

            <h2>DATT (Bharadvaj)</h2>
            <p>
              The name Bharadvaj can be analysed as 'Bhar - Dvayam-Imam'
              meaning-who will bring up the child-as there was a discussion on
              this point be­tween his mother and the father, Birhaspati Rishi.
              He was finally sired by the great emperor, Bharat, a Kshatriya.
              That is why the Bharadvaja gotra is shared both by Brahmins as
              well as the Kshatriyas. Bharadvaj became a gotra name and the
              Bharadvaja of Rama's time was a late descendant of the first
              Bharadvaja. He was a disciple of the Valmiki Rishi who had his
              hermitage at Chitrakoot. Rama during last days of his exile had
              stayed in his ashram, before returning to Ayodhya.
            </p>
            <p>
              India is named Bharat after Bharata, the son of Shakuntala,
              Vishwamitra's daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dronacharya, son of a later day Bharadvaja, was Commander-in-Chief
              of the Kauravas. His son Ashvathama and grandson Gaj Bhavan are
              equally adored by the Datts as their venerable ancestors. After
              the assassination of Dronacharya at the hands of Dhrisht Dyumna
              and the coronation of Yudhishtra as the king of Hastinapur,
              Ashvathama did not like to live in the kingdom of the erstwhile
              foes of his father, and went on exile out of India. Enroute to
              Kashmir and Kabul, he reached as far as Arabia. He was accompanied
              by six mates of his school days in the Gurukul of his father,
              named: Vidyadhar, Brahmo, Krishno, Hariram, Drona and Mohan. Some
              Mohyal historians have postulated that these personages along with
              Ashvathama were the real founding fathers of the seven clans of
              the Mohyals.

              Kashyap Rishi, son of Marichi and grandson of Brahma, was one of

              Major) or Sapta-rishi. When Parasurama performed his victory-yajna
              on the banks of river Sarasvati which in those days flowed near
              Kurukshetra, Kashyapa acted as the priest. He is believed to have

          <div class="about-mohyal--cast">
            <h2>VAID (Dhanvantari)</h2>
            <p>
              There is a legend in the Bhagavad Purana that during Amrit
              Manthan, the churning of the ocean by the demigods and the demons,
              fourteen ratanas were ferreted out and the last one to emerge was
              Dhanvantari, carrying Amrita, the elixir. According to the
              Ramayana, it was after continuous churning of 1,000 years that
              Dhanvantari arose with a kamandala and a danda. According to
              Harivamsha, he ascended from the sea and appeared with folded
              hands before Vishnu and Vishnu called him Abja. Dhanvantari prayed
              to Vishnu that as he was his son, he should be allotted a share in
              the bounty of the yajna. Vishnu told him that since he appeared
              after the gods, he could not claim the divine status, but agreed
              to bless him with another birth in the Dvapara-yuga and then he
              will have the ashtasiddhis of Isvara and be the author of the
              Ayurveda. Accordingly, he was born as the son of Dirghatapas (also
              known as Dhanva), the king of Kashi. Dhanva had no issue for a
              long time, he propitiated Abja and the latter was born to him as
              Dhanvantari. He was a genius of medicines, founded the Ayurveda
              and classified it into eight parts.
            </p>
            <p>
              During Amrit Manthan, the epic churning, the gods held on to the
              tail of the snake-god `Vasukr while demons (asuras) clung on to
              the upper part. The Mandar Hill (in Bihar, 40 miles from the silk
              town of Bhagalpur) served as the churning rod with the snake god
              wound around it. Fourteen precious things (Ratanas) obtained from
              the ocean included, besides Amrita, the fabled Kamadhenu cow and
              Apsaras viz., Menaka, Rambha, Tilottama, Urvishi and goddess
              Lakshmi. When demons snatched the pot from Dhanvantari, Vishnu
              appeared in the form of Mohini, the enchantress. The demons were
              in-ebriated and the pot was retrieved and its contents distributed
              amongst the gods only. That is why Dhanvantari is depicted holding
              the pot of ambrosia and seated in front of Vishnu's insignia.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Parikshit, the grandson of Arjuna, was cursed to die within 7
              days by snake-bite (the curse was uttered by Shringi because
              Parikshit had thrown a dead snake around the neck of his sage
              father Shamika, when he was in deep meditation and Takshaka, the
              Shiva's snake was chosen to be the killer as a worm in a fruit). A
              healer was sum-moned to cure him. This healer, according to some
              was Dhanvantari, according to others, Kashyapa. That is why the
              two are identified as one and the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              Actually, Dhanvantari gotra did not originate from any Brahm-rishi
              but was used as surname by the Brahmins who practised Ayurveda,
              over the ages. Later on, the followers of the Kashyap gotra also
              started displaying this with their names.
            </p>
            <p>
              The birthday of Dhanvantari is observed as Dhan-Teras (the 13th
              day of Ashad, Krishna Paksh) by the devout Hindus, two days before
              Diwali. Dhanvantari is also believed to be the founder of the
              famous Sabarimala shrine near Kottayam in Kerala.
